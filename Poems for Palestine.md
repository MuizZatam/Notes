## Oh Rascal Children of Gaza
**by Khaled Juma**

Oh rascal children of Gaza.
You who consistently disturbed me
with your screams under my window.
You who filled every morning
with rush and chaos.
You who broke my vase
and stole the lonely flower from my balcony.
Come back,
and scream as you want
and break all the vases.
Steal all the flowers.
Come back ...
Just come back ...

## The War Will End
**by Mahmoud Darwish**

The War will end,
The leaders will shake hands.
The old woman will keep waiting,
for her martyred son.
That girl will wait,
for her beloved husband
and those children will wait,
for their heroic father.
I don't know who sold our homeland,
but I know who paid the price.
